    "\n",

    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The CNN-RNN architecture I have chosen is the one from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf). They call this model the Neural Image Caption, or NIC. It's based on a CNN that encodes an image into a compact representation, followed by a RNN that generates a corresponing sentence. Experiments on several datasets show the robustness of the NIC in terms of qualitative results, the generated sentences are very reasonable . The values of the variables in task 1 are selected based on the findings form the paper mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I left the transform as it was. The transform resizes and normalizes the image correctly the pre-trained network I have chosen to use. It also does a random horizontal flip and a random crop which are pretty standard techniques used to reduce overfitting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** My trainable parameters are as follow:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) + list(encoder.bn.parameters())\n",
    "```\n",
    "I only train the parameters that are related to the LSTM part of the model. This is the fastest way to adapt the pretrained image model to the decoder. Fine tuning the pretrained image model will not work without having a prtrained LSTM model. In the paper [Show and Tell: Lessons Learned from the 2015 MSCOCO Image Captioning Challenge](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505636) they explain well why this is the case:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In the original set of experiments, to avoid overfitting we\n",
    "initialized the image convolutional network with a pretrained\n",
    "model (we first used GoogleLeNet, then switched to\n",
    "the better Batch Normalization model), but then fixed its\n",
    "parameters and only trained the LSTM part of the model on\n",
    "the MS COCO training set.\n",
    "For the competition, we also considered adding some\n",
    "fine tuning of the image model while training the LSTM,\n",
    "which helped the image model focus more on the kind of\n",
    "images provided in the MS COCO training set, and ended\n",
    "up improving the performance on the captioning task.\n",
    "It is important to note that fine tuning the image model\n",
    "must be carried after the LSTM parameters have settled on a good language model: we found that, when jointly training\n",
    "both, the noise in the initial gradients coming from the\n",
    "LSTM into the image model corrupted the CNN and would\n",
    "never recover. Instead, we train for about 500 K steps (freezing\n",
    "the CNN parameters), and then switch to jointly train\n",
    "the model for an additional 100 K steps. Training was done\n",
    "using a single GPU (Nvidia K20), and step time was about 3\n",
    "seconds. Thus, training took over 3 weeks â€“ parallelizing\n",
    "training yielded somewhat worse results, though it\n",
    "increased the speed to convergence.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I chose the Adam optimizer. In this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) they us the Adam optimizer for the MS COCO dataset, this is one of the most used optimizers for deep learning, [and maybe the best overall choice](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) when compared to other gradient-based optimization algorithms."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
    "\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "## Step 3: (Optional) Validate your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
